# MGI Solution Explorer in your CI Workflow

Learn how to use the MGI solution explorer's CLI to simplify your CI builds. Solution Explorer makes things like configuring build specs, build version numbers and other things extremely easy and locally debuggable.

### NOTE

During the presentation, I had a build agent up and running to demo how the builds look. This runner has been deleted, but the build workflow has been left up for reference.
